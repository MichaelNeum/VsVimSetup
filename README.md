# Visual Studio Setup

## VsVim
In order to be able to use vsvim properly the file in this repos should be used to store all of teh custom settings.
The file has to be stored in the user Root folder in a folder called "vimfiles" in order for VSVim to load properly.
Unfortunaly the .vimrc does not work for VSCode.
The following shorcuts are handeled by Visual Studio rather than Vsvim

* Ctrl+B
* Ctrl+C
* Ctrl+F
* Ctrl+H
* Ctrl+M
* Ctrl+T
* F1

### Vsvim Setup
Just copy the .vimrc to the root folder of your account.
e.g. C:\Users\florager\


## Visual Studio Extensions
These are all the Visual studio Extensions that I use:
